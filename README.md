## Introduction

The Cube class provides a basic representation of a cube with methods to calculate its volume and surface area. It serves as a simple example of a C++ class.

## Class Features

The Cube class has the following features:

- `getVolume()`: Method to calculate and return the volume of the cube.
- `getSurfaceArea()`: Method to calculate and return the surface area of the cube.
- `setLength(double length)`: Method to set the length of the cube.

## Getting Started

To use the Cube class in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Include the `Cube.h` header file in your project.**

3. **Implement the methods in `Cube.cpp` in your project.**

4. **Configure Build and Run Tasks:**
   - Make sure you have the necessary build and run configurations in your project. Check the `tasks.json` file for build tasks and the `launch.json` file for run configurations.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the Cube class in your C++ program:

```cpp
#include "Cube.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Create an instance of the Cube class
    Cube c;

    // Set the length of the cube
    c.setLength(3.48);

    // Calculate the volume and surface area
    double volume = c.getVolume();
    double surfaceArea = c.getSurfaceArea();

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "Cube Volume: " << volume << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Cube Surface Area: " << surfaceArea << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
